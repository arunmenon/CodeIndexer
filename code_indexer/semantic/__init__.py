"""
CodeIndexer Semantic Layer

This package provides an agentic implementation for semantic understanding of code:
1. Code querying and search
2. Code explanation generation
3. Intelligent code analysis

These components build on the foundational data created by the ingestion pipeline
and require the Google Agent Development Kit (ADK).
