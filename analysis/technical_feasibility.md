# Code Indexer: Technical Feasibility Assessment

## Phase 1: Indexing Pipeline

### ADK Compatibility
- **Sequential Pipeline Pattern**: Well-supported by ADK's core orchestration capabilities
- **Tool Integration**: Git operations through function tools is straightforward
- **Language Parser Integration**: Will require custom tools but conceptually sound

### Technical Considerations
- Parser implementation complexity varies significantly by language
- Java parsing (with generics, annotations) more complex than JavaScript
- Expect 1-2 weeks per language for robust parser implementation
- Neo4j graph model design critical for downstream performance

### Feasibility Rating: ★★★★☆ (High)
Implementation is straightforward with ADK, though language parser development complexity should not be underestimated.

## Phase 2: Embedding and Vector Store

### ADK Compatibility
- **Chunking Logic**: Implementable as custom ADK agents/tools
- **Embedding Model Integration**: ADK supports external model calling
- **Vector Store Operations**: Qdrant integration via function tools is viable

### Technical Considerations
- Embedding model selection critical for code understanding quality
- Open-source models like CodeBERT practical for on-premise requirement
- Storage requirements scale linearly with codebase size
- Expect 10MB-100MB of vector storage per 100K LOC (depending on chunk size)

### Feasibility Rating: ★★★★☆ (High)
Core functionality well-supported by existing technologies, though careful tuning required.

## Phase 3: Documentation Generation

### ADK Compatibility
- **LLM Integration**: ADK's model access patterns support this workflow
- **Scheduled Operations**: Can be implemented via external triggers to ADK
- **Confluence Integration**: Standard API operations via function tools

### Technical Considerations
- Quality heavily dependent on LLM capabilities
- Context window limitations may impact holistic understanding
- Confluence API rate limits need consideration for large documentation sets
- Expect 4-8 seconds per documentation unit generation (module/class)

### Feasibility Rating: ★★★☆☆ (Medium-High)
Core features viable, but quality tuning will require significant effort.

## Phase 4: Hybrid Search (RAG)

### ADK Compatibility
- **Tool-using Agents**: Well-aligned with ADK's LLM agent patterns
- **Multi-search Orchestration**: Parallel execution pattern supported
- **Answer Composition**: Fits LLM agent with context pattern

### Technical Considerations
- Query planning complexity non-trivial for hybrid search
- Vector + graph search latency impacts user experience
- Answer generation quality dependent on retrieval quality
- Expect 1-3 second response times for typical queries

### Feasibility Rating: ★★★☆☆ (Medium-High)
Technically viable but requires careful optimization for latency and accuracy.

## Phase 5: Feedback Loop

### ADK Compatibility
- **Event-driven Patterns**: Well-supported in ADK
- **Agent Reuse**: Leveraging agents from prior phases follows ADK patterns
- **State Management**: Session state crucial for feedback tracking

### Technical Considerations
- Event handling infrastructure needed
- User feedback collection mechanism required
- Improvement measurement methodology complex
- CI/CD integration for repo-triggered events needed

### Feasibility Rating: ★★★★☆ (High)
Core mechanisms well-supported, though holistic feedback system requires careful design.

## Phase 6: Deployment

### ADK Compatibility
- **Configuration Management**: ADK support for environment-specific settings
- **On-premise Execution**: ADK functions well in containerized environments
- **Cloud Integration**: Vertex AI pathway clear if needed

### Technical Considerations
- Resource requirements depend on codebase size and query volume
- Neo4j + Qdrant + ADK runtime forms core infrastructure
- Minimum viable resources: 8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 100GB storage for medium codebase
- Container orchestration (K8s likely) recommended for production

### Feasibility Rating: ★★★★★ (Very High)
Deployment approaches well-established for similar architectures.

## Integration Points Assessment

| Integration | Technical Approach | Complexity | Risk |
|-------------|-------------------|------------|------|
| Git → Parser | Standard Git operations | Low | Low |
| Parser → Neo4j | Custom parsing logic | High | Medium |
| Neo4j → Embeddings | Graph traversal | Medium | Low |
| Embeddings → Qdrant | Vector operations | Low | Low |
| Neo4j → Documentation | Graph queries + LLM | Medium | Medium |
| Documentation → Confluence | REST API | Low | Low |
| User → Query Interface | Web/IDE integration | Medium | Medium |

## Implementation Timeline Estimate

| Phase | Estimated Effort | Dependencies | Critical Path |
|-------|------------------|--------------|--------------|
| Phase 1: Indexing | 4-6 weeks | None | Yes |
| Phase 2: Embedding | 2-3 weeks | Phase 1 | Yes |
| Phase 3: Documentation | 2-4 weeks | Phase 1 | No |
| Phase 4: Search | 3-5 weeks | Phases 1 & 2 | Yes |
| Phase 5: Feedback | 2-3 weeks | All prior phases | No |
| Phase 6: Deployment | 1-2 weeks | All prior phases | Yes |

**Total timeline: 12-20 weeks** (3-5 months) for full implementation with a team of 2-3 engineers.
