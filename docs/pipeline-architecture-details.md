# CodeIndexer Pipeline Architecture Details

## Overview

The CodeIndexer follows a modular pipeline architecture that transforms raw source code into a knowledge graph and vector embeddings for semantic search. This document provides an in-depth explanation of each component in the pipeline, their interactions, and the value they provide to the overall system.

### 6. AST Iterator (`code_indexer.utils.ast_iterator.py`)

**Primary Classes:**
- `ASTIterator`: Abstract base class for AST traversal
- `DictASTIterator`: Traverses dictionary-based ASTs
- `FilteredASTIterator`: Filters nodes during traversal
- `StreamingASTIterator`: Processes large ASTs incrementally

**Value Proposition:**
- Memory-efficient traversal of large ASTs
- Filter nodes by type, name or custom predicate
- Support for multiple AST formats

- Streaming support for processing large files

**Key Utility Functions:**
- `get_functions()`: Identifies function nodes across languages
- `get_calls()`: Extracts function call sites
- `get_imports()`: Identifies import statements

**Cross-Reference with README:**
Enables the "Cross-File Resolution" feature by identifying function definitions and call sites that need to be linked.

### 7. Enhanced Graph Builder (`code_indexer.ingestion.direct.enhanced_graph_builder.py`)

**Primary Classes:**
- `EnhancedGraphBuilderRunner`: Builds the code knowledge graph

**Value Proposition:**
- Creates nodes for files, classes, functions, etc.
- Establishes relationships between code elements
- Implements placeholder pattern for cross-file resolution
- Supports multiple resolution strategies for performance
- Detects and resolves function calls and imports

**Cross-Reference with README:**
Implements the "Graph Building" stage with the "placeholder pattern" mentioned in the documentation, and enables the "Code Knowledge Graph" and "Cross-File Resolution" key features.

## Key Technical Innovations

### 1. Placeholder Pattern for Cross-File Resolution

The placeholder pattern is a two-phase approach to resolving cross-file references:

1. **Phase 1 - Placeholder Creation:**
   - When a function call to an external definition is encountered, create a placeholder node
   - Record the name, module, and other identifying information

2. **Phase 2 - Resolution:**
   - After all files are processed, resolve placeholders to actual definitions
   - Support multiple resolution strategies based on codebase size
   - Handle ambiguities through scope-based resolution

### 2. Multi-Language Function Detection

The AST Iterator's `get_functions()` utility identifies function definitions across languages:

```python
function_types = [
    # Python
    "FunctionDef", "function_definition", "Function", 
    # JavaScript/TypeScript
    "MethodDefinition", "method_definition", "function_declaration", 
    "method_declaration", "arrow_function", "generator_function_declaration",
    # Java
    "method_declaration", "constructor_declaration",
    # C/C++
    "function_definition", "function_declarator", "method_definition",
    # Go
    "function_declaration", "method_declaration",
    # Ruby
    "method", "singleton_method", "method_definition",
    # Generic
    "function", "method"
]
```

This normalization layer allows consistent handling of functions across languages.

### 3. Resolution Strategies

Multiple resolution strategies for cross-file references:

1. **Join Strategy:** Direct SQL-like joins for smaller codebases
2. **Hashmap Strategy:** In-memory lookups for medium-sized codebases
3. **Sharded Strategy:** Distributed processing for massive codebases

Each strategy optimizes for specific trade-offs between memory usage and processing speed.

## Pipeline Flow Example

For a file `example.py` containing a function that calls another function in `utils.py`:

1. **Git Ingestion:**
   - Clone or update the repository
   - Identify `example.py` and `utils.py` as changed files

2. **Code Parsing:**
   - Parse both files with Tree-sitter
   - Generate ASTs with standardized structure

3. **Graph Building:**
   - Create nodes for each file, class, and function
   - Identify the function call in `example.py`
   - Create a placeholder for the function in `utils.py`
   - Resolve the placeholder to the actual function definition

4. **Chunking:**
   - Divide the code into semantic chunks
   - Preserve relationships from the graph

5. **Embedding:**
   - Generate vector representations of each chunk
   - Store in vector database for semantic search

## Configuration Options

The pipeline can be configured through command-line arguments:

```bash
python -m code_indexer.ingestion.cli.run_pipeline \
  --repo-path /path/to/repo \
  --branch main \
  --full-indexing \
  --resolution-strategy hashmap
```

Additional configuration options are detailed in the code and documentation.

## Extending the Pipeline

New languages can be added by:
1. Installing the appropriate tree-sitter grammar
2. Updating the language extensions mapping in `ast_extractor.py`
3. Adding language-specific node types to `get_functions()` in `ast_iterator.py`

New analysis capabilities can be added by:
1. Creating new utility functions in `ast_iterator.py`
2. Adding new node and relationship types to the graph builder
3. Extending the chunking and embedding stages as needed
